**Heliograph**

*Align your teams. Amplify your impact.*

Vision
======

Heliograph transforms how B2B companies bridge the gap between
customer-facing innovation and core product development. Like the
heliograph of old---which focused the sun\'s broad energy into precise,
directed signals---Heliograph channels the diffuse energy of frontline
teams into clear, actionable direction for your entire organization.

We believe the most valuable innovations happen at the edge: in sales
calls, client implementations, and custom solutions. But too often, this
knowledge stays trapped---in spreadsheets, in Slack threads, in the
heads of forward-deployed engineers who built something brilliant for
one client. Meanwhile, product teams work in the dark, building features
no one asked for while ignoring patterns hiding in plain sight.

Heliograph is the AI-native platform that makes your organization move
as one. We connect the edge to the core, turning custom work into
strategic intelligence and enabling teams to row in the same direction.

The Problem
===========

B2B companies are standing still. Not because they lack talented people
or good ideas---but because those people and ideas are pulling in
orthogonal directions. The result is coordination chaos.

The Great Convergence
---------------------

Two powerful forces are colliding. From opposite directions, companies
are converging on the same painful middle ground---and nobody has the
infrastructure to navigate it.

**Product companies are becoming services businesses.** Especially at
the early stage, B2B and B2B2C companies must create custom approaches
for every customer. Onboarding isn\'t a product feature---it\'s a
bespoke engagement. Customer success means fitting into each client\'s
unique workflows, not asking them to adopt yours. What starts as
\"we\'ll productize this later\" becomes a permanent reality of
high-touch, customized delivery.

**Services companies are becoming product businesses.** The economics of
pure consulting don\'t scale. Smart firms are racing to productize their
expertise:

-   **Bain\'s Private Equity practice** is transforming commercial due
    > diligence from 100% manual, start-from-scratch engagements into
    > repeatable playbooks and purpose-built software.

-   **McKinsey\'s transformation work** increasingly deploys custom
    > software alongside consultants---tools that accelerate client
    > outcomes but then need to evolve into reusable assets.

-   Every major consulting firm is asking the same question: how do we
    > capture the intellectual property we create on engagements and
    > turn it into leverage for the next one?

**Both sides end up in the same place:** organizations where custom work
and core capabilities must flow seamlessly between each other---and
where the tools don\'t exist to make that happen.

The Symptoms
------------

-   **Lost Innovation:** Forward-deployed engineers, consultants, and
    > solutions teams build incredible custom solutions that never make
    > it back to the core product. Companies rebuild the same wheel
    > dozens of times.

-   **Broken Feedback Loops:** Sales knows what customers want. Product
    > doesn\'t. The gap between frontline insight and roadmap decisions
    > is filled with telephone games, lost emails, and forgotten feature
    > requests.

-   **Tool Fragmentation:** Teams cobble together Jira, Salesforce,
    > custom spreadsheets, and PowerPoint trackers. None of these tools
    > were designed for the messy reality of services-heavy,
    > customization-heavy businesses.

-   **Slow Iteration:** Getting stakeholder input on a UI mockup or
    > strategic decision requires scheduling meetings, chasing down
    > approvals, and manually synthesizing feedback. By the time you
    > have alignment, the moment has passed.

The rise of forward-deployed engineering has made this worse. Companies
like Palantir pioneered embedding engineers directly with clients to
build custom solutions. Now this model is everywhere---but the
infrastructure to learn from it doesn\'t exist. Every FDE is an island.

The Solution
============

Heliograph is an AI-native platform that unifies CRM, project
management, and stakeholder feedback into a single system designed for
customization-heavy businesses. Unlike existing tools built purely for
product companies, Heliograph embraces the reality that your most
valuable work often starts as \"custom.\"

Core Components
---------------

### 1. Edge-to-Core Intelligence

Heliograph automatically tracks every custom request, implementation,
and solution across your organization. Our AI agents analyze patterns to
surface what should become core:

-   \"Three enterprise clients requested similar SSO integrations this
    > quarter\"

-   \"This custom reporting feature could reduce implementation time by
    > 40% if productized\"

-   \"Here\'s a draft PR showing what it would take to move this to
    > core---estimated 2 sprints\"

The AI doesn\'t just flag patterns---it drafts prototypes, estimates
complexity, and shows product managers what\'s easy versus what\'s hard.
But humans always make the final call.

### 2. Heliograms: Instant Stakeholder Feedback

A \"Heliogram\" is our answer to the feedback problem. Think Typeform
meets Loom meets decision intelligence---lightweight, embeddable forms
that capture stakeholder input with full attribution and context.

Use cases:

-   UI preference polls: \"Which dashboard layout do you prefer? A, B,
    > or C?\"

-   Strategic questions: \"Does this company fit our ICP? Why or why
    > not?\"

-   Feature validation: \"Would this capability change your workflow?
    > Rate 1-10.\"

-   Implementation sign-offs: \"Confirm this matches your
    > requirements.\"

AI agents can generate Heliograms on the fly---a salesperson mentions a
client concern, and the system creates a quick poll to validate it
across the team. All responses are automatically attributed,
timestamped, and integrated into the relevant project context.

### 3. AI-Native Workspace

Heliograph is built for AI agents from the ground up. This isn\'t a
traditional tool with AI bolted on---it\'s a platform where humans and
AI collaborate natively:

-   **Sales asks, AI builds:** \"Client needs a custom export format.\"
    > The AI agent creates the customization, generates a test, and
    > opens a review.

-   **Bi-directional flow:** Product can push capabilities to the edge
    > just as easily as the edge can surface needs to core.

-   **Intelligent triage:** Requests are automatically categorized: Is
    > this a one-off? A pattern? A quick win? A major initiative?

### 4. Cross-Functional Collaboration

Unlike traditional project management tools that silo by function,
Heliograph brings everyone into the same conversation:

-   Sales shares customer signals with context, not just complaints

-   Marketing weighs in on positioning implications

-   Engineering provides feasibility estimates in real-time

-   Product makes decisions with full visibility

Competitive Landscape
=====================

Heliograph competes against fragmented workflows, not any single tool.
Our real competitors are:

  **Alternative**             **What It Does**                                                      **Why It Falls Short**
  --------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Jira + Salesforce**       The incumbent stack: CRM for customer data, Jira for product work     No connection between systems. Custom work is invisible. Requires manual translation between worlds.
  **Productboard / Canny**    Feature request tracking and roadmap prioritization                   Built for product companies, not services. Can\'t track custom implementations or handle the edge-to-core workflow.
  **Monday / Asana**          General project management and team coordination                      Generic tools without domain intelligence. No AI agents. No feedback collection. Just organized task lists.
  **Custom Internal Tools**   Spreadsheets, Notion databases, PowerPoint trackers, homegrown apps   Fragile, manual, siloed. Requires constant maintenance. No AI. No scale. Knowledge walks out the door.

**Our differentiation:** Heliograph is the only platform designed
specifically for the edge-to-core workflow. We don\'t force
services-heavy businesses into product-centric paradigms. We embrace
customization as a feature, not a bug---and use AI to turn that
customization into strategic advantage.

  

Target Customer
===============

Primary: Companies in the Convergence
-------------------------------------

-   **B2B/B2B2C product companies with high-touch models:** Early-stage
    > companies where onboarding and customer success require custom
    > approaches tailored to each client\'s workflows

-   **Enterprise software with FDE teams:** Companies that embed
    > engineers with clients to build custom solutions (the Palantir
    > model)

-   **Consulting firms productizing their IP:** Bain, McKinsey, BCG, and
    > boutique firms turning repeatable engagements into software and
    > playbooks

-   **Professional services going digital:** Any firm that deploys
    > custom software alongside human expertise and needs to capture
    > that value

Why Now
=======

1.  **The convergence is accelerating:** Product companies need more
    > services. Services companies need more product. Everyone is stuck
    > in the messy middle without tools designed for it.

2.  **FDE is mainstream:** What Palantir pioneered is now standard
    > practice. Every enterprise software company has some version of
    > forward-deployed teams, but no tools designed for them.

3.  **AI agents are production-ready:** For the first time, we can build
    > a platform where AI does real work---creating customizations,
    > generating forms, drafting code---not just chatbots.

4.  **Tool fatigue is peaking:** Companies are drowning in disconnected
    > tools. The appetite for unified platforms has never been higher.

5.  **Consulting firms are desperate:** The pressure to productize is
    > existential. Firms that can\'t capture and reuse their
    > intellectual property will lose to those that can.

Summary
=======

Heliograph is the operating system for companies that live at the
intersection of services and product. We help you capture innovation at
the edge, align your teams around what matters, and move faster
together.
