# Heliograph

*Quickly align, build, and codify your customer solutions with Heliograph*

## TL;DR

Heliograph combines project management, version control, and stakeholder tracking in one AI-native platform built specifically for forward-deployed engineers (FDEs). These teams sit at the intersection of sales, consulting, and engineering—too technical for pure CRMs, too customer-facing for pure dev tools. Existing solutions force them to cobble together Linear, SharePoint, Notion, and spreadsheets. We're building the integrated toolchain they actually need.

## Long-term Vision

Heliograph aims to bring developer best practices—version control, modular architecture, continuous iteration—to customer-facing technical teams. Our goal is to build the best toolset for organizations to create highly customized solutions for their customers while maintaining the ability to scale.

We're designing from the start for AI agent integration. This means structured data, clear APIs, and workflows that allow AI to search, implement, and iterate on work. Teams should be able to run multiple solution variants in parallel, let AI propose improvements, and merge the best ideas back into their core offerings.

## Short-term Focus

We're focused on forward-deployed engineers—a role that has emerged as defining for the 2020s. With AI making building faster than ever, the real constraint has shifted to understanding customers and designing systems that work for them. FDEs live at this intersection.

The problem: the toolchain for these roles doesn't exist. FDEs aren't pure developers (so GitHub alone doesn't work), aren't pure salespeople (so Salesforce alone doesn't work), and aren't pure consultants (so traditional project management alone doesn't work). They need something purpose-built that integrates CRMs, project management, and source control.

## Why Now

**AI enables faster building:** The bottleneck has shifted from 'can we build it?' to 'should we build it and for whom?'—exactly where FDEs operate.

**Role maturation:** FDE roles are becoming standardized across the industry. Companies like Palantir, Databricks, and many AI startups have made this a core function.

**AI-native opportunity:** Building now means designing for AI agents from day one, rather than retrofitting later.

## Product Areas

Heliograph is one integrated platform with three core modules. Each addresses a gap where existing tools fail FDEs.

### 1. Project Management

**The problem:** Linear and Jira are built for product teams shipping one product to many users. FDEs ship many custom solutions to individual customers. Service teams currently resort to low-tech checklists in docs, spreadsheets, or elaborate Notion setups.

**Our approach:** An integrated task system that connects directly to CRM data, so you can see which client needs what, who's working on it, and what the timeline is. Easy to create todo lists that match how people actually work, with tasks broken down into hours, days, weeks, months, and quarters. Native integration with version control for requesting feedback on specific versions.

**AI angle:** AI agents can search and implement tasks directly. AI-powered search prevents duplicate work and surfaces relevant past solutions.

### 2. Version Control & Review

**The problem:** GitHub is great for code going into one central CI/CD pipeline. But FDE work often involves notebooks, presentations, and project plans for specific clients. You end up forking repos or creating messy branch structures. Meanwhile, the alternative is SharePoint folders with manual versioning ('final_v3_FINAL.docx').

**Our approach:** Git-style versioning for all artifacts—presentations, project plans, documentation—not just code. Easy branching for client-specific variants while maintaining connection to a core 'main' version. Learnings from edge deployments can be merged back to the center; improvements to the center can be pushed out to the edge.

**AI angle:** Multiple AI agents can work on the same section in parallel, proposing different versions. Users choose the best variant to merge. The system learns which approaches work best across clients.

### 3. Stakeholder Management

**The problem:** Product orgs often keep stakeholder information in someone's head or scattered Notion docs. Service orgs use CRMs, but CRM hygiene is notoriously spotty, and there's no systematic connection between stakeholder requirements and the actual work being done.

**Our approach:** Simple integrations that give everyone visibility into what stakeholders need. Ability to maintain different requirement versions for different stakeholders, all tracked in one place.

**AI angle:** AI has access to stakeholder context to inform decisions and assist with communication, while humans retain control over relationship strategy.
