# Heliograph

*Align your teams. Amplify your impact.*

Heliograph is an AI-native platform that unifies CRM, project management, and stakeholder feedback for B2B companies navigating the intersection of product and services.

## The Problem

B2B companies are experiencing a convergence: product companies need more services, and services companies need more product. Everyone ends up in the same messy middle—where custom work and core capabilities must flow together—but the tools weren't designed for this reality.

The symptoms are everywhere:
- **Lost innovation**: Custom solutions built by forward-deployed teams never make it back to the core product
- **Broken feedback loops**: Sales knows what customers want, but product doesn't
- **Tool fragmentation**: Teams cobble together Jira, Salesforce, spreadsheets, and PowerPoint trackers
- **Slow iteration**: Getting stakeholder alignment takes longer than building the feature

## The Solution

Heliograph connects the edge to the core—turning custom work into strategic intelligence and enabling teams to move as one.

### Core Features

**Edge-to-Core Intelligence**
Automatically track custom requests, implementations, and solutions across your organization. AI analyzes patterns to surface what should become core capabilities.

**Heliograms**
Lightweight, embeddable feedback forms that capture stakeholder input with full attribution and context. Think Typeform meets Loom meets decision intelligence.

**AI-Native Workspace**
A platform where humans and AI collaborate natively—AI agents can create customizations, generate forms, and draft code, with humans making the final call.

**Cross-Functional Collaboration**
Break down silos. Sales shares customer signals with context, engineering provides feasibility estimates in real-time, and product makes decisions with full visibility.
