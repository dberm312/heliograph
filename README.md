# Heliograph

**The modern toolchain for customer-facing builders.**

One integrated platform combining project management, version control, and stakeholder tracking—built for teams who ship custom solutions.

## Core Modules

- **Project Management** — Ship many solutions to individual customers, not one product to many users. Tasks connect directly to CRM data.
- **Version Control & Review** — Git-style versioning for presentations, project plans, and documentation—not just code.
- **Stakeholder Management** — Track requirements and context for different stakeholders in one place.

## Built For

Forward-Deployed Engineers, Solutions Engineers, Technical Account Managers, Customer Engineers, Implementation Teams, and Consultants.
